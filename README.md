# Backpacker News

A community for sharing news about the why, where and how of people carrying their lives on their backs across this World.  

This is a project that I started in order to build my GraphQL skills. My main goal is to continue sharpening my GraphQL schema design skills. I'm also excited about working on a graphql-yoga project.

## Technical Foundation

I'm building this project on top of the great work Maira Bello did in this amazing [Node/GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-js/0-introduction/) tutorial.

## Further Info

For more information on this project please look through the code. I will work to add README's for the majority of the directories in this repo.
